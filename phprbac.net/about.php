                    <p>
                        PHP-RBAC is the de-facto authorization library for PHP. It provides NIST Level 2 Standard Hierarchical Role Based Access Control as
                        an easy to use library to PHP developers. It was initially developed in 2008 for use in early versions of jframework, but was matured and
                        ripped later from the jframework to be a stand-alone library.
                    </p>
